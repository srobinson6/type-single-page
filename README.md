    This project was my first real site that I have built. After a lot of trial and error, I was able to use the best of my abilities to create a website that was very delicate and playful just like the font Kalnia. I learned a lot about css grid and how it works when it comes to aligning text and images. While the font Kalnia is a lesser known font, I got most of my information from the "about section" on google fonts. This projects uses bright colors and shapes that makes it stand out from the rest. It represents the font itself and also who I am as an artist. The hero section is one of my stronger contributions to this project.
    
    There are multiple functioning features such as the navigation bar and the download button that links to the font. The images that were used came from the character set of the font. For example, the the flowers that surround the variable axis were created with the astrict symbol (*) in the font style. I wanted to show off the detailed curved in letters from the font so I added the letter "S" as the backgorund for the hero section. I did the best Im could to fully match my mockups in figma to the site. Overall, this was one of the harder projectes I have done and I am proud of myself for working through it and creating something I am proud of.
